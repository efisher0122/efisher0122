🌠 The best WordPress link management, branding, tracking & sharing plugin. Easily make kudos & trackable shortlinks. 🔗

== Description ==

Kudos Links helps you shrink, beautify, track, manage and share any URL on or off of your WordPress website. Create links that look how you want using your own domain name!

## Kudos Links 🌠

Kudos Links enables you to shorten links using your own domain name (as opposed to using tinyurl.com, bit.ly, or any other link shrinking service)! In addition to creating clean links, Kudos Links tracks each hit on your URL and provides a full, detailed report of where the hit came from, the browser, OS, and host. Kudos Links is a killer plugin for people who want to clean up their affiliate links, track clicks from emails, their links on Twitter to come from their own domain, or generally increase the reach of their website by spreading these links on forums or comments on other blogs.

## Examples 👇

This is a link setup using Kudos Links that redirects to the Kudos Links Homepage where you can find more info about this Plugin:

Here's a named kudos link (I used the slug 'aweber') that does a 307 redirect to my affiliate link for aweber.com:

http://blairwilliams.com/aweber

Here's a link that Kudos Links generated a random slug for (similar to what bit.ly or tinyurl would do):

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'kudos-link.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Make sure you have changed your permalink Common Settings in Settings -> Permalinks away from "Default" to something else. I prefer using custom and then "/%year%/%month%/%postname%/" for the simplest possible URL slugs with the best performance.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who will find Kudos Links useful? =
Kudos Links is particularly useful to affiliate marketers. It helps them to clean up, brand, group, organize, and track their links. In addition to affiliate marketing, Kudos Links is also useful to bloggers, podcasters, merchants, social media marketers, and anyone else who wants to easily take control of their link strategy.

= Can I use Kudos Links with any WordPress theme? =
Absolutely! Kudos Links operates mainly in the WordPress admin, but the front end features should be totally compatible with any WordPress theme.

= How do I get started with Kudos Links? =
Getting started with Kudos Links is incredibly easy. Everything you need to know you can find on our [Getting Started page](https://kudoslinks.com/helpdesk_category/getting-started/).

= Is Kudos Links Translatable? =
Yes! Kudos Links is ready for translation. See our [Translating Kudos Links](https://kudoslinks.com/docs/translating-kudos-link-pro/) documentation for more information on how you can translate the plugin into your language.

= What are the differences in redirect types? =
301 (Permanent) redirects are used to tell search engines that a requested URL has been permanently moved to another URL. If you're confident that your target URL will never change, then use this redirect type. 302 and 307 (Temporary) redirects tell search engines that the requested URL has been moved temporarily, but will be back eventually.
